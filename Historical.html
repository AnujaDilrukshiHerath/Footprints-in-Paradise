      <h2><center>Anuradhapura</h2></center>
      <p>Historians believe that from around 4th century BC to the 11th century AD, Anuradhapura was 
	  the capital Sinhalese and a thriving economic hub in South Asia. Although Anuradhapura’s history is
	  easily traced from the 4th century BC, excavations have been able to identify artefacts from the Iron
	  Age which easily dates back to 900 BC. It is believed that from those times the community grew and flourished
	  to become one of South Asia’s grandest kingdoms. There are some famous historical places you can visit in
	  Anuradhapura to spend your holidays. the Bhodi tree of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi in India, under which Lord 
	  Buddha attained enlightenment, was planted in Anuradhapura. The Sri Maha Bodhiya is the oldest documented
	  tree that is still living. The city also has palaces, monasteries and monuments (all in ruins) that are
	  fascinating to visit.Ruwanwelisaya, an ancient stupa, is revered by the Buddhist community. Thuparamaya
	  enshrines the collarbone of the Buddha and is considered to be the first dagaba, or pagoda, built in Sri Lanka.
	  Lovamahapaya also known as the Brazen Palace is between the Ruwanvaliseya and Sri Maha Bodhiya. Jetavanarama is
	  the largest stupa in Sri Lanka. As well as these beautiful places there are other stupas and relics, soaring over
	  the vast acres of paddy fields in the area.</p>

        <h2><center>Sigiriya</h2><center>
      <p>Sigiriya, Sri Lanka is a small town that has become famous because of one particular attraction – Sigiriya
	  Rock (or Lion Rock as some call it.) It’s easily one of the most impressive places to see in Sri Lanka.￼ Sigiriya
	  Citadel Rock. The palace is located in the heart of the island between the towns of Dambulla and Habarane on a 
	  massive rocky plateau 370 meters above the sea level. Sigiriya rock plateau, formed from magma of an extinct 
	  volcano, is 200 meters higher than the surrounding jungles.Its view astonishes the visitors with the unique 
	  harmony between the nature and human imagination. The fortress complex includes remnants of a ruined palace, surrounded
	  by an extensive network of fortifications, vast gardens, ponds, canals, alleys and fountains. The surrounding 
	  territories of Sigiriya were inhibited for several thousand years. Since 3th century BC the rocky plateau of 
	  Sigiriya served as a monastery. In the second half of the 5th century king Kasyapa decided to construct a royal
	  residence here. After his death Sigiriya again became a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century, when it was
	  abandoned. When you travel this place you will feel like living in a different world.</p>
